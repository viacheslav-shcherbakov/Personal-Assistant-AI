# Personal Assistant AI
 Similar to a Jarvis type project.

- Uses microphone to speak with AI
- Dynamic AI name (set the name the bot is looking for dynamically)
- A custom commands framework (kinda works)
- Easily add new trainers
- db.sqlite3 database

Uses PyAudio, there is a installer `setup.bat` that should take care of the dependencies.
This doesn't do a ton right now but its a good start for someone who wants to make a AI they can speak with naturally.
